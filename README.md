# MoviePad Demo Website

This project was first developed in my second year of university for my Human Behaviour in Cyber Security module. 


It was a group project where we had to create a website that would allow users to rent movies. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
The website was designed to be a simple movie rental service, where users could browse movies, add them to their cart, and checkout. The website also had a user authentication system, allowing users to create accounts and log in.

This project has been modified outside of the module to be dockerised.
It is currently being refactored to use a more modern stack. This stack with be a MERN stack with a React frontend and Node.js backend.
The current stack is a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a Node.js backend.

(This project is currently in maintainance and is not in a production ready state. It is a demo website for educational purposes only.)
