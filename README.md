# MoviePad Demo Website

This project was first developed in my second year of university for my Human Behaviour in Cyber Security module.

It was a group project where we had to create a website that would allow users to rent movies. The website was built
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The website was designed to be a simple
movie rental service, where users could browse movies, add them to their cart, and checkout. The website also had a user
authentication system, allowing users to create accounts and log in.

## Tech Stack

- frontend: HTML, React, TailwindCSS, react-router, redux
- backend: Node.js, Express
